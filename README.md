# 🌍 Passport Power Analysis with R

This project focuses on analyzing the **strength of passports** across different countries.  
Data cleaning, visualization, and analysis were carried out using the R programming language.  

## 📊 Variables Used

- **Mobility Rank** → Global ranking of travel freedom  
- **Visa Free** → Number of countries accessible without a visa  
- **Visa on Arrival** → Number of countries offering visa on arrival  
- **Visa Required** → Number of countries requiring a visa  
- **HDI (Human Development Index)** → Human Development Index score  
- **Political Stability** → Political stability indicator  

## 🎯 Objectives

- Quantitatively compare passport strength across countries  
- Explore the relationship between visa-free travel opportunities and socio-economic indicators  
- Highlight cross-country differences through data visualization  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **R** (data analysis & visualization)  
- **ggplot2** (for graphics)  
- **dplyr** (for data manipulation)  

## 📌 Outputs

- Visualization of passport rankings  
- Analysis of the relationship between HDI, political stability, and passport power  
- Cross-country comparisons of travel freedom
